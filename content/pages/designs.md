  # Design patterns inspired by polish folk culture.

  In this section, I would like to tell you more about different types of our beautiful regional patterns.

  Chosen patterns presented below have their origins in polish folk embroidery, traditional folk costumes, and traditional paper cutouts.

  ## Lowicz paper cutouts – shape and colour

  Lowicz paper cutout, which developed in Central Poland is the most recognisable and probably the most beautiful Polish paper cutout.
  Here it is not only the shape that is important but also the colour. Lowicz cutout is a composition of 5, 7, or even 10 colours.
  “Gwiozda” and “Kodra” are the most important shapes. They are made by gluing consecutive layers of elements.
  “Gwiozda” is a symmetrical composition, filled with floral motives and roosters. “Kodra” is a rectangular cutout, often showing scenes from everyday life. In the past “Kodra” was attached to ceiling beams as a decoration.<br>

  ## Embroidery of traditional Lowicz roses

  Embroidery is a well-known branch of Lowicz handicraft. Traditionally, it was made with colourful threads on black velvet. The most characteristic Lowicz patterns are the bouquets of flowers. The most common motive is a rose, but pansies and other flowers are often used as well.

  ## Kashubian embroidery – symbolism and history

  Kashubian embroidery is inspired by the beauty of nature. Flower motives are the most characteristic: pansies, cornflower, blue-bells, carnations, lillies, forget-me-nots and roses.
  They are presented with unusual precision and attention to detail.<br>

  <br>There are various schools of Kashubian embroidery using different characteristic motives and colour schemes:

  ### Zukow school

  The oldest school of Kashubian embroidery. The name comes from the Norbertinian convent in Zukow, where the style was developed. The popular motives include tulip, clover, rosette and heart (filled with a checkered pattern); seven characteristic kashubian colours are used.

  ### Tuchola and Borowiec schools

  The most atypical embroidery schools. Instead of using the seven traditional colours, they use the shades of gold and amber (Tuchola) and gold and brown (Borowiec).

  ### Wejherowo school

  Wejherowo embroidery may be recognized by the dominance of red and yellow and characteristic motives of dahlia, chryzanthemum, lilac leaves and cowberry.

  ## Highlander Parzenica 

  A parzenica is a heart-shaped traditional handicraft pattern and decorative folk art of the Goral people, who live in the mountainous region of southern Poland. It is often found embroidered on the upper front side of men's trousers.
  This characteristic decorative motif probably originated in Hungary, and by the beginning of the 20th century it became one of the most recognisable decorative patterns in the Podhale region.

  ## Floral patterns from Zalepie

  Zalipie also known lovingly as “The Painted Village,” nearly every bare surface in the village, be it stone or wood has been decorated with intricate floral patterns in a tradition that dates back almost a hundred years. While there is little concrete evidence to support the story, the belief is that the habit of painting flowers on the walls began in the days when soot and smoke issued from everyone’s tiny wood-burning stoves. As the black marks from the soot appeared on the interior and exterior walls of the homes in Zalipie, the women would simply cover them with painted flowers.
  By the time of the turn of the century, the old world stoves were replaced with chimneys and cleaner modern ventilation, eliminating the practical need for the tradition, but instead of dying out, the practice just became more elaborate. By this time, the decorative tradition was a part of the Zalipie identity and with the advent of better paints and more varied colors, the rustic floral patterns expanded to intricately weaving vine illustrations accented by vibrant flowers in every color of the rainbow.
